# Getting Started

This toolkit is a guide to NYPR tools and external tools that can help you engage with your listeners. It's for producers, hosts, and anyone who wants to increase audience participation and build community, or tell a story in a more interactive or engaging format. These efforts can lead to growth in listenership or increase the likelihood that your listeners will become members and support your work.

NYPR has defined a step-by-step process to help you engage with your audience:

## <a name='identify-your-goals'>Identify your goal(s)</a>
Identifying your goals will help you identify what tools you need to use to achieve those goals.
What do you hope to gain by engaging with your audience that we can measure and observe.

Maybe you want to:

* *increase pageviews*
* *gather feedback for a story*
* *increase newsletter subscribers or live event attendees*
* *grow your social media reach including shares and comments*
* *increase your video views, livestream listens or on-demand listens*
* *increase monthly or weekly active users*

You may want to complete this [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJtjVhNWH6Lx1NoGyRW37iSI1Q9ruAQiuUg6yDy6D50/edit) to help you think through everything.

## <a name='identify-audience-goals'>Identify your audience's goal(s)</a>

What value can you provide to your audience through your engagement project? Sometimes the answer to this is simple: my audience loves the show so much that they just want to give me feedback all the time. But in other cases, it may be more complex.

Some examples of audience drivers:

* *I want to feel connected to other listeners.*
* *I want to be reminded to tune in to an upcoming livestream event.*
* *I want to share my story.*

It’s important to keep in mind that if you’re asking your audience to give you something personal such as an email, you often have to give them an incentive. An incentive in this case might be a follow-up email with bonus content or information.

## <a name='get-it-out-there'>Get your engagement tool out there</a>
Many of the tools in this toolkit provide an interactie experience for your listeners. A lot of them are free and easy to set up. You can link to them or embed them in story pages on New York Public Radio websites or link to them from social media. You can also promote the tool in podcasts or on air.

To expand the reach of your project, don’t hesitate to reach out to Audience Development, Social Media, Marketing, Membership and the Digital team.
